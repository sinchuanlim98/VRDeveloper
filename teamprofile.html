					<h2>Group Processes</h2>
					<p>  While doing the assignment 2, we actually try to separate all the work equally so that no one will do more work than others and we finished our part on time without rushing. We also try to help each other when we have done our own part as a team. We didn't have much time for meeting together to discuss assignment 2 so we used Wechat to keep the connection with each other. Therefore, this time we are going to use the same method to organise our work into 6 parts equally. For making sure that everyone has learnt something different from the assignment 2, so we try to pick the different part of work to do. We will also try to give each other some recommendation for improving our work and also get a higher mark than assignment 2.</p>

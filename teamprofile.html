					<h2>Group Processes</h2>
					<p>  While doing the assignment 2, we actually try to separate all the work equally so that no one will do more work than others and we finished our part on time without rushing. We also try to help each other when we have done our own part as a team. We didn't have much time for meeting together to discuss assignment 2 so we used Wechat to keep the connection with each other. Therefore, this time we are going to use the same method to organise our work into 6 parts equally. For making sure that everyone has learnt something different from the assignment 2, so we try to pick the different part of work to do. We will also try to give each other some recommendation for improving our work and also get a higher mark than assignment 2.</p>
					<h2>Career Plans</h2>
					<h3>Jackson</h3>
					<h4>Career Plan</h4>
					<p>This is the word "full-stack" that interests me. When I went to the workplace, I really wanted to be an engineer that can do everything. The full-stack requires a programmer to have multiple skills from the front end to the back end. This means that it will be more dependent on the development process. A person can complete a project that usually only one team can complete, which is great. In order to be capable of doing that job, I will try to learn all the basic web technology. Afterward, I will try to seek a job position regarding the web development. Through the years of training, I may ultimately secure related job position.</p>
					<h5>Full-stack Engineer</h5>
					<p>Requirement</p>
					<p>-4-5 years working experience</p>
					<p>-A relevant degree</p>
					<p>-Familiar with javascript</p>
					<p>-Familiar with current web technologies like reactjs.nodejs,vuejs…</p>
					<p>-Strong project managing experience</p>
					<h3>Defu</h3>
					<h4>Career Plan</h4>
					<p>I would try to get an internship with IT work related while I am at the second year of my university journey. When I have gained enough experience and knowledge, I would find a job which might allow me have a opportunity to be trained and gain more skills. Two years later, I might get a new job which required more skills which is another opportunity to improve myself. After several times of changing my job, I have gained a lot of experience and skills when I am probably 35, I could run my own company or maybe run it with some of my friends.</p>

					<h3>Jenny</h3>
					<h4>Career Plan</h4>
					<p>I would like to finish my degree with Chinese language study because I believe being multilingual, especially being able to communicate in Mandarin is an advantage when applying for jobs. I hope to have internships while studying or after my degree, then once I have finished my internship I’ll be applying for jobs. I like the thought of work and live in a different culture so the jobs I am hoping to get will be the one that let me travel to another country/countries, or give me the flexibility of working remotely. My future goal is to run my own company as I prefer working for myself as the boss than working under someone.</p>
					<h5>Technology Manager</h5>

In addition, when i am in winter or summer holiday, i would like to take this time to travel with my friend. As we know,  a stable friendship might help your further career plan. What’s more, traveling allows you to develop your mind. Therefor, I would not waste every second during my advanced studies. In contrast, i would have a very specific planning on every stage.</p>
					<h5>Helpdesk Services</h5>

					<p>1. Product Manager</p>
					<p>The first position must be the PM, product manager, who design the product and makes it come true. Product managers are responsible for directing the success of the product and leading the team to improve it. It is a very important role, especially in IT companies.

The first is strategic thinking which starts with asking the right questions, then understanding the market and competition, and finally defining the product roadmap. The product manager must have the ability to predict how long each stage of the production cycle will take, place its product to take advantage in the market, and conceive strategies to make costs lower and control risks throughout the product life cycle.</p>
					<p>The second skill is analytical skills that follow strategic thinking. This is about the research and analysis of the user data to make product decisions profitable. This is a skill which is driven by data rather than completely based on intuition. A product manager who has strong analytical skills understands how to use the data and form solutions for business strategy, developing products.</p>

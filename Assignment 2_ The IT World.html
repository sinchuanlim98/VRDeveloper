In </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y64 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assignment 1, we learnt how to build a basic w<span class="_ _6"></span>ebsite by using AWS and other </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y65 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tutorial websites like w3school. However, in this one, we learnt to use a </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y66 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">website template which is tend to be a much efficient w<span class="_ _6"></span>ay to<span class="_ _1"></span> build a more </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y67 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better-looking website for everybody in our group. We all also have a glance </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y68 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at how those Information Technology<span class="_ _6"></span> professionals deal with their job and </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y69 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how to solve the problems they might encounter. <span class="_ _6"></span>We are able to get to know </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y6a ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the newest technologies at the moment, and try<span class="_ _6"></span> to see and find out what the </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y6b ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">future world would look like.

Furthermore, </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y6d ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those robots can make our world and l<span class="_ _1"></span>ife robotic and effectiv<span class="_ _6"></span>e, which can </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y6e ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">improve our life quality from many aspects. So much stuff has been learned </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y6f ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and seen by us, and this increases our view<span class="_ _6"></span> to the whole world. The only thing </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y70 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that should be improved is that people could starting w<span class="_ _6"></span>orking on <span class="_ _1"></span>the<span class="_ _1"></span>ir set work </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y71 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earlier so that we can have more time to discuss and prepare, w<span class="_ _6"></span>hich might </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y72 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lead to a better outcome. We were thrilled and surprised by how the w<span class="_ _6"></span>orld has </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y73 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually been changed so fast. <span class="_ _6"></span>W<span class="_ _1"></span>e just realised that there are many<span class="_ _6"></span> aspects </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y74 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of our daily life have been improved so much, we just did not notice, and </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y75 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore, our world would be a much better one when we group older. <span class="_ _6"></span>W<span class="_ _1"></span>e </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y76 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were going to say “grow<span class="_ _6"></span> up”, however, we are just far too late to realise that </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y77 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are almost 20 years old, almost one fifth of our life span. W<span class="_ _1"></span>e should work </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y78 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">harder and study more, try to finish everything on time, never ev<span class="_ _6"></span>er leave our </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y79 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assignment or other work until the last minute or second. <span class="_ _6"></span>W<span class="_ _1"></span>e must remind </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y7a ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">each other to do some revisi<span class="_ _6"></span>on, so that we can pass the exams on other </div><div class="t m0 x4 h3 y7b ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subjects as well.

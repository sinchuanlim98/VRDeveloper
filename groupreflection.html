					<h2>Jacksen</h2>
					<p>Defu lin is so excellent just like a famous faction in his hometown, PuTianXi. (https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%25E8%258E%2586%25E7%2594%25B0%25E7%25B3%25BB&prev=search). Throughout the whole semester of IT tutorial, he repeatedly imply me to teach him programming! I do love to help others but decline the requests from the morally questionable. He is so shameless and narrow-minded that he can't understand I'm not his 'father'. I neither want to control him nor have the duty to teach him. As he said during the speech ‘you don’t know my name?’. I don’t know either. Overall, the team works very well and each team member can complete the work and understand the task. In the group work, although the difference between nationality and cultural understanding, but the coordination is basically the same. Effective communication can promote overall progress, and poor communication can hinder the smooth progress of work. We need to further strengthen communication between members. Although communication is inefficient, team members are still responsible and can stabilize the entire team. The most confusing part of our team's work is the division of labor, because in the division of labor, calculating the workload is very important to make sure that each member of the team get an equal share. For this part, we did not do well. </p>
					<h2>Defu</h2>
					<p>I appreciate every member of this team who has done a incredible impressive work to finish up this assignment. It is great to see everyone of us has put a lot of effort on the work. Especially Jackson who has done the final part of the assignment which required plenty of effort to finish it up. I also want to say thank you to our group leader Jenny this time, who indicated us the direction and suggestion of the whole assignment, and she is incredibly resourceful, and keeps encouraging us not to tackle the assignment at the very last minute, thanks again Jenny! Thank you Chuan, helps doing the tools part！Eddie, you should do your work as early as you could, because when we are about to finish everything up, you are still cooking! Done nothing but cooking! Well, thanks anyway, I learned how to be patient. For Junjie Chen, I welcome you to join our group, appreciate what you have contributed to this assignment, I know you were the earliest person to start this assignment, I really like your attitude when you encountered language problem, you were resilient, you always solve at the end and never left problem behind! Above is how we finished up the assignment and hopefully, we would be satisfied with the final mark.</p>
					<h2>Jenny</h2>
					<p>This is probably the most stressful assignment for me out of all the assignment in this course of Introduction of Information Technology. We started the assignment quite late at the time when we need to study for our exams, everybody was busy studying and preparing for exams. It was also a terrible time for me to work on assignment and study for exams because my family was preparing for moving, the day I moved was only one day before the deadline. Everything was too much to handle at times, team mates some times are too busy to respond to group messages so sometimes I get confused about who’s doing what and at what stage. I would like to thank Chuan and Jacksen for good work as always, Defu for being responsive and willing to do extra work, Eddie for doing the parts he was given even though he started a bit late, Steven for being responsive and enthusiasm even though he just doesn't seem to understand what the question is asking him to write.</p>
					<h2>Eddie</h2>
					<p>It is been really amazing to work with my group mates in IT world assignment. To be  done the great job, we do have a great leader inspiring with lots of thoughts and giving us much energy and confidence to finish the work. What’s more, we equally divided the assignment, which is definitely difficult part in the beginning. Because you need to know everyone in your group, which is the part they are expected to do or the theme they are familiar with. Everyone in my group is really gorgeous and quite helpful. What I mean is that they are certainly willing to help you search the unfamiliar part or the one you are not understanding. What I am surprising is that after i read the assignment we did in google docs, i cannot imagine we could do this twenty-plus pages, which really make me excited here. As one of the member in our great group, I’ve learned that the job we have done in group might be relatively better to individual work. It is simply because everyone come up with lots of ideas and everyone has the part they are good at. Last but not least, i hope to work with this guys again in next assignment.</p>
					<h2>Chuan</h2>
					<p>This time, we have a new member joining our group and it really helps a lot to finish our assignment faster than working in a group of five. I was surprised that we can equally separate our work and finish it on time. Everyone is doing a great job of helping each other. It was fun to work in this group but sometime we might have different opinions and start arguing. However, as a team, we still can understand each other and work together very well. This assignment will be the final assignment for this course so I will be happy to work with this team in future.</p>
					<h2>Steven</h2>
					<p>By doing this assignment, l learnt a lot from cooperating with other people, how to use critical thinking, search and learn to understand more research about this project. l think this project provides a good facility for us to learn and use the concept of information technology.</p>

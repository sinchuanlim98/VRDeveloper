						<h1>Project Description</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<h3>Topic</h3>
					<p>Virtual Reality Board Game</p>
					<p>The project is about developing a VR board game based on the game Carcassonne, we will be researching the target market, our competitors and learn how to develop the game as a team.</p>
					<p>We will learn how to use the Unity game engine to develop our game, learn how to design mountains, landmarks, etc. and make them interactive. We will also learn to create sounds such as background music and sound effects for interactive features.</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>The motivation for doing this project is because Jenny’s (our team member) older sister is a fan of board games and she always complains that she never have anyone to play board games with, the board games that she owns usually requires 4 or more people to play. We know that board games are popular, and still are but because of how advanced technology is, nowaday people are more interested in online games, mobile applications, consoles than board games. But if we are able to put the current technology to good use, we could get back the love for board games and for people like Jenny’s sister – who can’t find anyone to play with them, will be able to connect and interact with others using the VR headsets while enjoying their favorite board games.</p>
					<p>We saw an opportunity for success when the announcement for a Catan VR game was released, there were a lot of interests gained from the media and people on social media. If we are able to create a VR version of another popular board game, we will be likely to attract the same kind of interest and we can also learn from what Catan VR developers well have done and do the same or better. To future employers, our experience gained from working on this project will be valuable as we’ll have skills related to graphic design, game development, Unity, marketing and advertising, programming, Virtual Reality development and that we were able to work as a team or by ourselves with the same mission in mind.</p>
					<h3>Landscapes</h3>
					<p>A good number of popular board games have been developed to enable players to play them in virtual reality, some of the popular titles are Catan, Monopoly, Gloomhaven, etc. Even though VR games isn’t as popular as consoles or mobile devices’ games (the reason being the cost of the VR headset is still out of reach for the majority of the people) but it is gaining more popularity, because of the experiences provided by theses headsets won’t be available through other methods and there are some applications/games only available in VR which pushes the consumers to buy them.</p>
					<p>Compares to the current games available on the market, our games will focus on ensuring that players will be able to feast on the sights, sounds, and interactive features when playing the game. Similar games can be lacking in the visual aspect - players don’t have their own avatar or they can’t choose their own, sounds - some games don’t have a lot of sounds effects provided with interactive elements of the game or they don’t have background music to enlighten the player’s mood, interactive features - some games limited on what element of the game can be interactive such as buildings, towns, animals can respond when touched.</p>
					<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
					<h3>Aims</h3>
					<p>The main aim or focus of this project is to “Develop Carcassonne VR board game” because it is our passion to develop a game that will help the members of the team and their family, or anyone with a VR headset to enjoy the tradition board game with a twist with other people whatever distant they may be apart on Earth. This aim requires our team to work and/or hire people who can work on achieving the goals that will lead to the successful development of the game.</p>
					<p>Our first goal for the project is to “Research the market” to find out what the competitors have done well, what can be improved and what the consumers/players are looking for. This goal is set to ensure that we know our market and what kind of audience we are developing the game for so that we won’t make the same mistakes, and improve upon what our competitors have done to help them succeed with their games.</p>
					<p>The second goal is to “Plan a timeline” so we could keep ourselves on track with each stages of the project. Each second is precious, by following a timeline we could keep our focus on the project and ensuring that we do not miss any stages necessary for the development of the game. The game will be able to release on set time and not being drag on and on, failing the promise made to the consumers and losing their trust, like what happened to a lot of our competitors.</p>
					<p>The third goal is also very important for any project, it is to make sure that our team “Hire the right people for the right job”. By hiring the right people we will reduce the possibility of hiring people multiple times if the one we hired previously have to be replace due to circumstances. We don’t have to waste unnecessary time and the right will people doing the right job will ensure the workflow and the team work to be in sync and consistent.</p>
					<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
					<p>The idea for the project originally was from one of the team member’s suggestion, other team members found it interesting so everyone decided to make it a project that we could work toward as it will be a great experience and project to include on our profiles. We are a team of people with similar interest and from the same class, these similarities helps us keeping in touch easier and motivate each other on keeping the project going.</p>
					<p>The first thing we’ve done as a team is have regular meetups to discuss the ideas we have for this project, we’ve done brainstorms to keep our ideas flowing and connected. After each meetup we went home and did our own research about the current market and what similar games are available to know who are developing for and also who we are competing against.</p>
					<p>After having a general idea of what kind of game we wants to develop, we went on to research what kind of game engine we should use to develop our game and decided that Unity game engine is the most suitable for the game that we’ll be developing. Unity enable us to design avatars and characters, music and sound effects, landscape, level, menu, interactive features, etc.</p>
					<p>One of our team member who owns a Wacom tablet (a drawing tablet used by artists and designers to draw digitally, it is a useful tool to draw and design the characters and avatars for the game) tried her hand at designing in Unity with Wacom and found it challenging because she doesn’t have great drawing skills, so we decided that it’s best for us to recruit a student studying graphic or visual design to do the design which required drawing skills on our project.</p>
					<p>Eddie - a resourceful team member went into developing the basic programming framework and then Jacksen - our team most knowledgeable about programming, developed the framework even further.</p>
					<p>Leea - the design student that we have recruited finalised her design after countless of failed design. We then run our application prototype which we created using invisionapp to test the UX, after receiving feedback we worked upon improving it and then we did our first stage testing.</p>
					<h3>Roles</h3>
					<p>We as a team, absolutely have defined some specific roles for our VR game. We have an Appearance Designer, who designs the looking of the sceneries, landmarks and characters that would show up and display in the game. First job is to draw some drafts of the sceneries, landmarks and characters just simply according to what had been designed on the original game. Then we have to draw the designs properly on the computer using a Wacom tablet Unity game engine. The designer is to consider what colour and what shape could be utilised to make these designs consistent and pleasant to look at. There could be minor difference between what we have designed and their original looks, which might make the sceneries, landmarks and characters look more stereoscopic while users are playing our game.</p>
					<p>We also have an App Designer, who has the ability to create the prototype of our game app by using various online tools such as proto.io and invisionapp. When the prototype is done, the designer should start building the actual high-fidelity app immediately.</p>
					<p>Our Lead Developer shows our teammates a better way to tackle a specific task. For example, he could provide some suggestion on the looking of the monsters if the Appearance Designer needs. He could also help to give some ideas on the app design if our App Designer is in trouble. He is always there to ensure that the product we have produced or developed should be in a highest possible quality efficiently. Moreover, he also does some non-technical jobs, such as creating a survey or even an interview for those users that have experienced our product and get the feedback effectively.</p>
					<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
					<p>There are a diversity of elements that have been included in our project, especially for those Carcassonne or board game fans, Carcassonne has been a cult favourite for many years in the board game community. They would love to see every single sceneries, landmarks or characters that are designed and available on our game, however, the interactive feature of these designs are yet to be available at this stage. So only the basic playing features are designed to be available on the app first and we would wait for the first batch of users to experience them and give us feedback, then we would improve the designs and even fix the bugs once based on the feedbacks from the players. We then design the interactive features once we have more available time. On the other hand, the players are also able to choose their avatar and adjust sounds volume.</p>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>Unity game engine is used to design the game which includes level, characters, sounds, menu, scoring, etc.</p>
					<p>Wacom tablet is used to draw and design sceneries, landmarks and characters for the game based on the original game. Jenny studied Visual Communication Design in high school and owns a tablet so she have some skills to work and design with the Wacom tablet.</p>
					<p>VR headset is required for testing out the visual and gameplay.</p>
					<p>Fast and powerful computer is used to run the game engine and to build the experience in VR.</p>
					<p>Invisionapp is used to make prototype of the game app for UX testing.</p>
					<h3>Testing</h3>
					<p>The testing process of this project will be decided into three stages. At the first stage of testing, different roles in the group (ie. Appearance designers and other designers) should be invited to participate in the testing process to give insiders’ advices. The purpose of this approach is not only to prevent information leak out during early stage of development, but also gaining professional and/or semi-professional suggestions and advices within the group of developers. The second stage would include a small amount of players who is somewhat familiar with this board game as this would help designers to gain a broader perspective. This stage is critical because it would be the first time that actual players get to comment on this game, and their comments should be taken very seriously. A test monitor should be included in this testing stage as several professional support may be needed. However, the monitor should be cautious about giving comments or advices that’s misleading, as honest feedback from the players are essential. The third stage of testing would include a wider range of players that may or may not include the first group of players, and this testing process would be ideally conducted before the official launch of the game, and the players should test the game without any support from the development team member, as a subjective conclusion could be made whether the game is ready for the market.</p>
					<h3>Timeframe</h3>
					<p>The timeframe is uploaded in the assignment 3 pdf file.</p>
					<h3>Risk</h3>
					<p>Our project is some sort of new product to the existing market, the wide public might not accept the VR game too soon when we have the chance to release. Moreover, this type of game does require a headset so that the game can be played properly, which does cost some money. Therefore, one potential risk is that the players and users might not get used to this new type of game and cannot afford to purchase a headset, the outcome could be that this VR game does not have the chance to become so popular. </p>
					<h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
					<p>We usually meet in our tutorials class once a week every Thursday and contact each other by Wechat group or Facebook Messenger outside of class regularly. If a member does not respond to a message we usually tag them in the chat or talk to them at school, but usually everyone responses messages online almost every time they are tagged.</p>
